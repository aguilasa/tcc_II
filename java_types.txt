String	A Java String. Its default size depends on the underlying backend (if you use JPA, itâ€™s 255 by default), but you can change it using the validation rules (putting a max size of 1024, for example).
Integer	A Java Integer.
Long	A Java Long.
Float	A Java Float.
Double	A Java Double.
BigDecimal	A java.math.BigDecimal object, used when you want exact mathematic calculations (often used for financial operations).
LocalDate	A java.time.LocalDate object, used to correctly manage dates in Java.
Instant	A java.time.Instant object, used to represent a timestamp, an instantaneous point on the time-line.
ZonedDateTime	A java.time.ZonedDateTime object, used to represent a local date-time in a given timezone (typically a calendar appointment). Note that time zones are neither supported by the REST nor by the persistence layers so you should most probably use Instant instead.
Duration	A java.time.Duration object, used to represent an amount of time.
UUID	A java.util.UUID.
Boolean	A Java Boolean.
Enumeration	A Java Enumeration object. When this type is selected, the sub-generator will ask you what values you want in your enumeration, and it will create a specific enum class to store them.
Blob	A Blob object, used to store some binary data. When this type is selected, the sub-generator will ask you if you want to store generic binary data, an image object, or a CLOB (long text). Images will be handled specifically on the Angular side, so they can be displayed to the end-user.
